<h2>why learn Arduino?</h2>
<p>The Arduino is one of the most <i>under</i>powered computers you can buy today. Its processor is slow, and it has very little memory (2Kb!). And yet, it is quite popular with both nerds and artists. This is because of three reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>It is cheap.</b> At the time of writing, an 'official' Arduino costs a little over 20 euros. Chinese clones can be found for about 5 dollars, and such clones are not flakey fakes: the hardware design of the Arduino is public, and free for everyone to use, and so are the software tools to program Arduino and its clones.</li>
  <li><b>It is easy</b> to connect all kinds of electronics to an Arduino. With many similar little computers (and big ones), you have to solder wires to the circuit board, or use complex programming tools to get anything working. Usually both. With Arduino neither: just plug in some wires.</li>
  <li><b>It is relatively easy</b> to write programs that make the electronics do fun or important stuff. You don't need to study programming for months or years to get going. The amount of things you need to learn to master the Arduino is a lot less than most programming systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this course, there is another reason why Arduino is very interesting. While there are thousands of programming languages, almost all of the mainstream languages fit on a spectrum that has JavaScript on one end, and Arduino's programming language (C++) on the other end. If you want, or need, to learn a different language, say PHP, Swift, Java, or Python, you will find that many (if not all) aspects of this new language are either similar to JavaScript, or similar to Arduino C++ (or a bit of both). And by seeing the many similarities between Arduino and JavaScript, you are learning the properties that are fundamental fundamental to most other languages.</p>
<p>By teaching you both JavaScript and Arduino, <b>we are preparing you for programming in almost all other useful programming languages.</b> No introductory course that uses just one language can do that just as effectively. And this course could not do this <i>in a fun way</i> without the Arduino.</p>
<p>How much fun is the Arduino? That is, basically, up to you. But do have a look at these two video's, that show some Arduino projects, and give you a sense of what Arduino enthusiasts like to use it for:</p>
<p><i>This video is specifically about Arduino in design and art projects:</i></p>

    <h3 class="assignment questions">1.4: your first Arduino program</h3>
    <p>A poet has created a witty poem.</p>
    <p>Write an Arduino program that prints the following poem to the Serial Monitor:</p>

    <i>The limerick packs laughs anatomical</i><br>
    <i>Into space that is quite economical.</i><br>
    <i>But the good ones I’ve seen</i><br>
    <i>So seldom are clean</i><br>
    <i>And the clean ones so seldom are comical.</i><br>

    <p>(It is also OK to use a different multi-line poem or joke)<br>
    Use five print commands, and make sure that the poem is <b>only printed once</b>.</p>

    <div class="instruction">
      <p>In the this exercise, and many, many exercises after this one, you have to send in the code you created.</p>
      <p>Please follow these two instructions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Copy-paste the program into the mail</b> &mdash; don't add it to the mail as an attachment or a link to some site. </li>
        <li>Send in <b>the entire code</b> &mdash; not just the part where you've made your changes. </li>
        <li>Send in <b>an unmodified copy</b> of the program. &mdash; Some programs, such as MS Word or (sometimes) Outlook, try to make text look better by replacing straight qoutes (i.e. ' and ") by curled quoute characters (i.e. ‘’ and “”). Prevent this from happening, because programming tools really don't like curly quotes.</li>
      </ul>
      In class, your teacher will select some of the programs that have been sent in, en try them live in class and then discuss them. This works better if it isn't necessary to save attachments, add missing pieces of code or restore quotes in class.

    <h3>calculating with <i>operators</i></h3>
    <p>For calculations, programming languages use symbols that are available on keyboards, and some are different from what you've learned at school:</p>
    <table>
      <tr><td style="width: 5em;">
           <code>22 <b>+</b> 33</code>
        </td><td>
           adding
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td>
          <code>22 <b>-</b> 33</code>
        </td><td>
          substracting
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td>
          <code>22 <b>*</b> 33</code>
        </td><td>
          multiplying is done with a <b>*</b>, because &times; does not exist on keyboards, and the letter <i>x</i> would confuse the compiler.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td>
          <code>22 <b>/</b> 33</code>
        </td><td>
          dividing is done with a <b>/</b>, because &divide; does not exist on keyboards, and 2D formulas like <img src="fraction.png" style="vertical-align: middle;height:2em;"> can't be used in text files.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td colspan="2">
        There are many more <b>operators</b> like this in programming languages, such as:<br>
        ^, ||, >, <=, !, ||, &, ==, etc.

    <h3>grammar rules for programming: <i>syntax</i></h3>
    <p><i>Syntax</i> is the word we use for the set of rules about how you write things in a programmming language. Every language has it's own <i>syntax</i>, but many aspects of syntax are shared among most languages. Here a a few basic rules found in many languages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>names</b> for commands (and other things) must start with a letter, and cannot contain spaces or symbols (like + or % or ;). </li>
      <li><b>operators</b> for calculations (see box above) cannot contain letters or numbers. They are made with one or more symbols. Examples of names that are OK in the vast majority of programming languages are:<br> <code>score</code>, <code>Score</code>, <code>SCORE</code>, <code>score_player_2</code>, <code>scorePlayer2</code>.</li>
      <li><b>strings</b> denote pieces of text that a program uses <i>as text</i>. They are written inside quotation marks, like <i>"hello world"</i> in the command `Serial.println("hello world"). </li>
      <li><b>comments</b> denote pieces of text that a program <i>will not use</i>. Use them to add explanations to the code in your own language, or to disable certain lines of the program. Most often, comments start with // .</li>
      <li><b>braces and parenthesis</b> such as <code>( )</code> <code>{ }</code> or <code>[ ]</code> are used to create structure in programs. You've seen, for example, the curly braces { } being used to tell the compiler which commands are part of the <code>setup</code> of the program, and which commands belong to the <code>loop</code>-part of the program. <br>Braces and parenthesis are always used to <i>group</i> things in your program, but what that grouping actually <i>means</i> can vary. For example, parenthesis in calculations have the extra effect that they make part of the calculation happen before other parts are calculated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Space characters</b> are only used to keep items in your program apart. That is why you can't have names or numbers with a space in them: the compiler will think you have two names, and get confused. Often they are optional. In the line <code>Serial.println("game over");</code>, no spaces are needed to keep the names, the symbols and the string apart. They are, however allowed: <code>Serial .  println (    "game over" ) ;</code> is exactly the same.</p>
    <p>Wherever a space is allowed (or required), you're free to add multiple spaces. You can also use line-end characters (a.k.a. newlines) in such places, or tab characters. So the following lines still mean the exacte same thing as the example in the previous paragraph:</p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-arduino">
          Serial .               
            println    ( 
              
            
          "game over"  // like paragraph-ends and tabs in MS-Word, line-ends and 
                )      // tabs count as characters, and can be deleted and copy-pasted.
            ;
    </script>
    <p>But please, write code like this :-). It doesn't confuse the compiler, but it will confuse your teachers, your teammates, and even you yourself (after a few days).</p>

There actually is a situation where it matters if you have one, or two, or more spaces.<br> Can you write a variant of the <code>Serial.println("game over");</code> command where an extra space changes the result of the command?</li>
      <li>Also, the rule that says that newlines can be added where spaces are allowed, has an exception.<br> Look at the multi-line example above.

   <h2>the S4D breadboard</h2>

  <youtube ytid="jKQ4R7ype4g"/></youtube> 

    <p>Although the prototype in the video did have one, the breadboards we use during the course <b>do not have a light sensor</b>.
    It turns out we did not need them, and the ones we ordered we of low quality. Sorry about that.</p>

    <h3>one more thing: installing U8g2</h3>
    <p>Oops! The previous video forgot to mention something important. To be able to program the little display on the breadboard, you need to install a 'library' in the Arduino IDE. This is a plugin, called <b>U8g2</b>, that is needed to get the Arduino to work with the OLED display. The short video below show how to install the library. Watch it and do it.</p>
    <youtube ytid="AkJNPCRhSk8"></youtube>
      
    
    <p></b>You <i>have</i> to install U8g2, before continuing with the rest of this chapter.</b> After installing U8g2, you can forget about it. You won't meet it again, and it isn't important for learning to program.</p>
    <h2>testing the S4D breadboard</h2>

  <p>Before you can start with the exercises using the Arduino breadboard, you need check that every part of the breadboard is connected correctly.</p>

  <h2>the breadboard header file</h2>

  Some components on the breadboard, like the OLED screen and the volume sensor, require some extra code to create the commands to program them conveniently. This code, along with some other helpful stuff is provided in a <i>header file</i> called '<b>s4d_breadboard.h</b>'. This file is a helper file that you will use in all of the Arduino exercises in this course.
