        var pasta = "Spaghetti"
        var sauce = "Bolognese"
        var cheese
        cheese = "Parmesan"

    <h3>expressions</h3>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-javascript" data-line=3>
      var brand = "BMW"
      var type = "Isetta 300"
      var carName = brand + " " + type
      alert( carName )
    </script>
    <p><i>(that's <a href="https://www.inexhibit.com/case-studies/the-history-of-the-iso-bmw-isetta-the-worlds-first-microcar/">this magnificent vehicle</a>)</i></p>
    <p>Calculations can also be done with pieces of text. Textual data in programs are called <b>strings</b>. The code above creates two variables that have strings ("BMW" and "Isetta 300") as their value. Then, on the highlighted line, it creates a new string by combining those values, with a string containing a single space inbetween. Although the code uses the + symbol, it's not an addition, and we call this operation a <i>string concatenation</i>.</p>
    <p>It is a bit of a stretch to call string concatenations <i>calculations</i>. The better term any piece of code that creates a new value (text, number or other kinds) is <b><i>expression</i></b>.</p> 
    <p>An expression in a variable assignment is everything to the right of the "=" sign. In previous examples, we also used expressions between the parentheses of a function call.  An expression always results in a single value that can be stored in a variable, or used as inputs to a function call like <code>alert("BMW" + " " + "Isetta 300")</code> or <code>console.log(17/4 + 8))</code>.</p>
    
    <h4>mixing text and numeric expressions</h4>
    <p>It is very common in programs to have expressions that mix string concatenations with numeric calculations. Here's an example:</p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-javascript">
      var message = "The movie 'The Irishman' is " + ( 3 * 60 + 29 ) + " minutes long."
    </script>
    <p>When you mix text and numeric operations, use parenthesis, i.e. ( and ), to avoid confusion (between + for adding numbers and + for concatenating text).</p>

      <section class="assignment">
        <h3>4.4: calculations and strings</h3>
      <p>Take the following code snippet:</p>
      <script type="text/plain" class="language-javascript">
        var lecturer = "Robert"
        var lecturer2 = "Jille"
        var votesForLecturer1 = 29
        var votesForLecturer2 = 30
      </script>
      <p>Add a fifth line that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uses the variables above in single expression</li>
        <li>to create the value "Jille is the favourite lecturer after 59 votes were counted. Robert lost by 1 vote.",</li>
        <li>and uses result as the input of an alert.</li>

      <p>Tip: Not all quotation marks play well with code. Note the difference between: single quotes (') , double quotes (") and curly quotes (“).  </p>

        var a = "This is a string"

      <h3 class="assignment questions">4.7: magnet detector</h3>

      <p>The HAL sensors from AliExpress can be flakey. On some breadboards they will give a value of around 600 when no magnet is near. On other boards, the no-magnet value is close to 500 or even lower. When a magnet is held close to the sensor, the value may go up, or it may go down.</p>
      <p>We would like an audible magnet detector that will work on different breadboards. So, how do you know, when you read a value of e.g. 600, if there's a magnet coming near the sensor? One trick is to <i>calibrate</i> your program: measure the no-magnet value when to program starts (assuming the magnet is not close when the program starts). Then, to see if a magnet is getting near, you look at the <i>difference</i> between the values you read from the sensor, and the no-magnet value. When these differences become larger, you know a magnet is approaching, regardless of the exact no-magnet value of the sensor on the breadboard.</p>

      <script type="text/plain" class="language-arduino">
#include "s4d_breadboard.h"
int initialMagnetValue;
 
void setup() {
  initializeBreadboard();
  // 1. Calibrate our magnet detector by assigning the no-magnet value to 
  //    the "initialMagnetValue" variable in the setup.
}

void loop() {
  // 2. Make a new variable that has the current magnet reading as a value.
  // 3. Make a new variable that calculates the difference between the 
  //    control value and the current value. Use the built-in abs() function 
  //    to make the difference-value always be positive. abs(-100) is 100, and
  //    abs(100) is 100 too.
  // 4. Use Arduino's built-in tone(pin, frequency) function to make sound 
  //    corresponding with the proximity of a magnet. Maybe you need to multiply
  //    the difference variable by a factor of 6 or 8 to make the detector usable.
}
      </script>
      
        <p>Use the plan in code above to create a magnetdetector in arduino. You're going to need two functions that are built-in to the Arduino language:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>tone(BUZZER, 1000); </code> makes a tone at 1000 hertz.</li>
          <li><code>abs(number)</code> makes the <i>absolute</i> value from an input. This means abs(-2) is the same as abs(2). If you don't understand where you can use this, don't worry. You can still get a sort of ok solution without it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(More built-in functions are documented at <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/">the Arduino Reference</a>)</p>
