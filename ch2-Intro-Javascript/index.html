  <h1>Chapter 2: Intro to Javascript</h1>

  <p>This chapter introduces the Javascript -- a language that is used to make websites interactive. In this chapter we are going to use javascript commands to change the html that is displayed in the browser.</p>

  <div class="attention">
    <p>Do you have some knowlegde of HTML and CSS? These are computer languages for creating web pages. They are not programming languages; HTML describes the content and structure of a web page, and CSS is used to describe the colors, fonts, sizes and other visual design properties of the elements in the HTML file. </p>
    <p>Because you can't write computer programs in HTML/CSS, this course is not going to invest time teaching them. But to be able to use Javascript for interesting things, a little bit of very basic knowledge about HTML and CSS is required.</p>
    <p>If you're unsure about your HTML/CSS knowlegde, check out the online course on the Kahn Academy on HTML and CSS: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages</a></p>
    <p>For our course, you only need the first four chapters of their course:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-html/v/making-webpages-intro">Intro to HTML</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-css/pt/css-basics">Intro to CSS</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/html-tags-continued/pt/html-links">More HTML tags</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/css-text-properties/v/css-zen-garden">CSS text properties</a></li>
    </ol>
    The rest of the course is interesting too, but not needed for this programming course.

    <p>In the following exercise, and many, many exercises after this one, you have to send in the code you created.</p>
    <p>Please follow these two instructions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Copy-paste the program into the mail</b> &mdash; don't add it to the mail as an attachment or a link to some site. </li>
      <li>Send in <b>the entire code</b> &mdash; not just the part where you've made your changes. </li>
      <li>Send in <b>an unmodified copy</b> of the program. &mdash; Some programs, such as MS Word or (sometimes) Outlook, try to make text look better by replacing straight qoutes (i.e. ' and ") by curled quoute characters (i.e. ‘’ and “”). Prevent this from happening, because programming tools really don't like curly quotes.</li>
    </ul>
    In class, your teacher will select some of the programs that have been sent in, en try them live in class and then discuss them. This works better if it isn't necessary to save attachments, add missing pieces of code or restore quotes in class.

    <p>Perhaps you're a fan of a particular browser, say Google's Chrome or Apple's Safari. In that case, we need to ask you to let go of your attachment during this course. Browsers are quite similar, but not completely. And little differences can derail some of the assignments in this course. We want everyone to use the same browser in order to learn the same tricks, get the same results in experiments, and see the same wording of error messages.</p>
    <p>From now on, therfore, we want you to star using the <b>Firefox browser</b> for the exercises in this course. Firefox is, in many subtle ways, a bit better for learning Javascript (and HTML/CSS) than Chrome, Safari or Edge. If you haven't already installed Firefox, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">you can download it here.</a></p>

        An element's CSS-style can be changed using Javascript. Below are two examples: 
      </p>
      <script type="text/plain" class="language-js">          
         document.getElementById("caption").style.backgroundColor = "blue"
         document.getElementById("caption").style.padding = "2pt"
      </script>
      <p>
        <span class="inline-note">Note:</span>All style properties known to CSS can be changed this way. But, sometimes, the spelling needs to be different in Javascript. In a CSS-file, you would write <code>background-color</code>. Notice that in this Javascript example the <code>background-color</code> property is written as <strong><code>backgroundColor</code></strong>. This is because the "-" dash symbol cannot be used in Javascript names.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Use javascript to add style to the caption element, making the background "HAN Pink" (#e50055) and the text color white.
