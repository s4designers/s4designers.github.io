    <p>What if you've taken a step in the right direction, but you're not there yet. <b>You take more steps.</b><br> What if you're trying something, and it works a bit, but not completely? <b>You could try again.</b><br> What if you looked for something, and you haven't found it yet? <b>You continue looking for it elsewhere.</b><br> What if you've got a list of items to do, and you've only done the first few items? <b>You continue with the rest of the list.</b><br> What if you've done something that turned out to be a mistake? <b>You could fix the mistake, and try again</b> (but a bit differently).
    <p>Repetition is a recurring part of life. One of the cool things about programming is that you get to <i>design the repetition</i>, but you don't have to <i>live the repetition</i>.</p>

      <h4>13.2.b: the silent killer</h4>
      <p>Let's freeze a browser. First, take some precautions. You don't want to lose browser tabs or sessions that are valuable to you.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have a browser installed that isn't running right now, start it, and use that one.</li>
        <li>If you haven't, you could download the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Developer Edition of Firefox</a>, and install and use that one. Other cool browsers are: <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> and <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi</a></li>
        <li>If you insist on using a browser that you have already running, here is how to restore all your open tabs after the crash: <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/restore-previous-session">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/291019/how-to-restore-your-chrome-tabs-when-theres-no-re-open-last-session-button/">Chrome</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now, after making sure it's OK if the browser crashes: Replace the <code>alert()</code> command in the code with a <code>console.log()</code> command.</p>
      <p>Then, reload the script in the browser. First enter the value 1000, and check that you get the expected output.</p> 
      <p>Finally, reload, and enter the value <i>"S4D is cool"</i> (or something similar).</p>
      <p>Answer this question: does the browser display the console.logs in the console panel?</p>
      <p>Here's how to kill a frozen broswer <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-force-quit-a-program-in-windows-2625781">in Windows</a>, and <a href="https://www.parallels.com/blogs/force-quit-on-a-mac/">on a Mac</a>.</p>

      <h4>13.2.c: Fixing the bug.</h4>
      <p>One way of fixing the bug is to get the user to enter a positive whole number before starting the while loop. You can do this with <i>another while-loop!</i>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a function called <code>isPositiveInteger(number)</code> that returns <code>true</code> if the number is safe for the main repetition. Use the following built-in function as part of the new function:<br>
          <script type="text/plain" class="language-js">
            Number.isInteger( 3.4   )  // => false
            Number.isInteger( 3000  )  // => true
            Number.isInteger( -3    )  // => true
            Number.isInteger( -3.96 )  // => false
          </script>
        </li>
        <li>After prompting the user for input, you can now check if the number is OK (in the sense that the main while-loop can terminate (=stop running)). Do this with a while-loop that simply asks the user again for a number if the previous input was not OK.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>it does not print title and artist of the songs;</li>
        <li>it creates a local variable (before the loop) to hold the sum of all durations (what should be its starting value?);</li>
        <li>it adds the duration of each song to the sum-variable.</li>
        <li>it has the total duration a its return value.</li>

      <h4>13.3.d: separating the algorithm from the side effects</h4>
      <p>It is often best if a complex calculation is done without side effects. This helps, for example, in testing the code.</p>
      <p>Create a function that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>also uses a while-loop to find the first songs in a playlist that fit into a maximum duration;</li>
        <li>takes both the playlist and the maximum duration as arguments;</li>
        <li>does not print anything to the console;</li>
        <li>instead, it creates a new empty array, and adds the qualifying songs to this new array (which array function is useful for this?);</li>
        <li>this array will be the return value.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>TIP: if you change the function from 13.3.a to take the play list as an argument, you can use it to print the output of the function you write for this exercise. </p>

    <div class="theory">
      <h2>one more repetition: for loops</h2>
      <p>There is another repetition statement in most programming languages. It can do the same things as the while-loop, but it's much more popular. It is called the <i>for-loop</i> and it looks like this:</p>
      <script type="text/plain" class="language-js">
      // recall from the video that 'myCounter += 2' means 
      // the same as 'myCounter = myCounter + 2'

      for( var myCounter = 1; myCounter < 10; myCounter += 2 ) {
        console.log("Doing repetition with myCounter:", myCounter)
      }

      // Doing repetition with myCounter: 1
      // Doing repetition with myCounter: 3
      // Doing repetition with myCounter: 5
      // Doing repetition with myCounter: 7
      // Doing repetition with myCounter: 9
      </script>
      <p>For-loops are while-loops with extra's. Notice that inside the round parentheses after "for" there are <i>three small pieces of code</i>, separated by ';'.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first part,<code>var counter=0</code> in the example, is almost always used for <b>setting up a counter variable</b>, and giving it its starting value.</li>
        <li>The second part, <code>counter < 10</code> in the example, is the <b>condition</b>, which determines if the commands are executed for another round of the loop. <i>Exactly the same</i> as the condition in a while-loop. Usually it compares the counter to the final value at which the loop must end.</li>
        <li>The third part, <code>counter += 2</code> in the example, is the <code>update command</code>, and its task is to bring the counter variable closer to the end-value.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So this is the general structure of a for-loop:</p>
      <pre>
        for( <i>initializer</i> ; <i>condition</i> ; <i>updater</i> ) {
          <i>commmands to repeat</i>
        }
      </pre>
      <p>A while-loop runs like this:<br>check-condition &ndash; run-commands &ndash; check-condition &ndash; run-commands &ndash; check-condition&hellip; </p>
      <p>A for-loop runs like this:<br> <i>initializer</i> &ndash; check-condition &ndash; run-commands &ndash; <i>updater</i> &ndash; check-condition &ndash; run-commands &ndash; <i>updater</i> &ndash; check-condition &ndash; run-commands &ndash; <i>updater</i> &ndash; check-condition&hellip;</p>

      <h3>for-loops with arrays</h3>
      <p>For-loops are particulary useful with arrays. Every time you want to do something with each item in an array spearately (like printing the titles of the songs in a playlist), you need a repetition. Because array's are very common in most software, the following use of for-loops is why for-loops are more popular than while-loops in most software:</p>
      <script type="text/plain" class="language-js">
      var cities = ["Zevenaar", "Didam", "Groessen", "Babberich"]
      for( cityCounter = 0; cityCounter < cities.length; cityCounter++ ) {
        var currentSong = cities[ cityCounter ];
        // do cool stuff with the current city
      }
      </script>
      <p>Here, we use the length of the array as the end-value for the loop.</p>

    <h3>13.8: the template engine</h3>
    <p>Many web applications use a template engine to generate (parts of) their HTML pages. A template is a piece of HTML code that has places where data should be inserted. This could be a template (with data-placeholders marked between {{ and }}):</p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-js">
    var postTemplate = 
      '<div class="post">' +
      '  <h2>{{title}}</h2>' +
      '  <h4>by {{author}}</h4>' +
      '  <p class="postText">' +
      '    <img src="{{imageURL}}" style="height:6em;">' +
      '    {{postText}}' +
      '  </p>' +
      '  <div class="postFooter">' +
      '    <a href="mailto:{{author}}@han.nl">contact {{author}}</a> -- ' +
      '    <a href="mailto:robert.holwerda@han.nl">complain about "{{title}}"</a>' +
      '  </div>' +
      '  <hr>' +
      '</div>'
    </script>
    <p>This code concatenates a lot of strings. That is because each literal string value (in double or single quotes) must end on the same line where it was started. So one way of creating a very long string is like the code above.</p>
    <p>Notice all the placeholders, like {{title}} and {{imageURL}}. They don't mean anything special to HTML or Javascript. If you add this string a webpage, the browser would simply display all the curly braces. We have to create software to replace the placeholders with the actual data. Here is a simple example:</p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-js">
    var myPosting = {

        <h4>13.8.b: step 1 &ndash; repeated replacements</h4>
        <p>The grand project in this series of exercises is to create a general template engine that will render HTML from any template with data from JavaScript object. The code above is nowhere near that kind of flexibility. Let's solve the problem in a few steps.</p>
        <p>Did you notice that the render function has to call <code>.replace()</code> two times for {{title}}, and three times for {{author}}? That is because the <code>.replace()</code> function will <i>only replace the first occurrence</i> of the search string, not all of them. We need a more general repetition for replacing data placeholders.</p>
        <p>Create a new function that takes three arguments. It creates a new string, based on <code>baseString</code>, with <i>all occurrences</i> of <code>searchString</code> replaced with the value of <code>replacementString</code>.</p>
        <script type="text/plain" class="language-js">
      function your_name( baseString, searchString, replacementString ) {
         // your code here
      }
      var resultString = your_name( "aaa bbb ccc bbb aaa", "bb", "-")
      console.log(resultString)
      // =>  "aaa --b ccc --b aaa"
        </script>
        <ul>
          <li>You must replace multiple times. What kind of loop will you use? A while-loop or a for-loop?</li>
          <li><span class="inline-note">TIP:</span>You are done replacing when the last replacement did not create a new string. So you'll have to check whether the result of the replacement is (not) equal to the value before the replacement.</li>
          <li>
            <hint steps=1>
              <p>create two local variables: <code>currentResult</code> and <code>nextResult</code>. Give them sensible starting values. The loop goes a bit like this:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>do one replacement, based on currentResult, and store the new string in nextResult;</li>
                <li>check whether nextResult is different than currentResult; exit the loop when they are equal;</li>
                <li>in the loop, after the check, copy newResult into currentResult; and do another replacement.</li>

        <h4>13.8.c: step 2 &ndash; parameters for the render function</h4>
        <p>The current render function works on two global variables. So we cannot re-use the function for other templates and other objects with data. Start making the function reusable by adding two parameters.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One parameter is the input for the template string.</li>
          <li>The other parameter is the input for the Javascript object containing the data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Change the render function that in no longer reads the global variables, but works on its parameters instead. Also change how you call the function, to provide values of the global variables as the arguments.</p>
        <p>No need to send anything in yet. Do test that your code still works correctly.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="theory">
        <h4>using objects as array's, sort-of</h4>
        <p>Values in array's are stored under a index-number. In objects, values are stored under a name. We have seen how you can use variables instead of literal numbers to get items from an array. Could you do something similar with objects?</p>
        <p>Yes you can:</p>
        <script type="text/plain" class="language-js">
        var character = { 
          name:    "Severus Snape", 
          house:   "Slytherin", 
          job:     "professor", 
          subject: "Potions" 
        }

        var propertyName = "job"
        console.log( "The job:", character[propertyName] )

        while( propertyName != null ) {  // prompt() returns null is user presses "Cancel" button
          propertyName = prompt("Give a property name for the character")
          console.log( "The value of character." + propertyName, "is:", character[propertyName] )
        }
        </script>
        <p>Copy this code straight into the browser console; see what happens. Experiment a few times with the two commands in the loop. They demonstrate how you can get data out of the object, even if you (the programmer) does not know what property name will be used. What happens if you enter a property name that doesn't exist in the object (e.g. <i>salary</i> or <i>#&@*%</i> )?</p>
        <p>For this you need the square brackets, making the notation look similar to getting a value from an array. If you use the dot-notation, e.g. <code>character.propertyName</code>, JavaScript will look for a property called "propertyName". After the dot, you need the literal name of the property. Inside square brackets, you can place any expression that results in a string. That string will then be used as the property name.</p>
        <p>This feature does not exist in Arduino.</p>
      </div>
      <p>There's another cool thing we'll use for the template engine:</p>
      <div class="theory">
        <p>The built-in function <code>Object.keys(object)</code> (notice the capital letter O) gives you an array with all the property names found in the object. Like this:</p>
        <script type="text/plain" class="language-js">
          var character = { 
            name:    "Remus Lupin", 
            house:   "Gryffindor", 
            job:     "professor", 
            subject: "Defence Against the Dark Arts" 
          }

          // 'key' is, in the jargon, synonym for 'property name'
          var propertyNames = Object.keys( character ) 
          console.log( propertyNames )
          // => ["name", "house", "job", "subject"]
        
          // This comes in very handy with a loop:
          for( var index = 0; index < propertyNames.length; index++ ) {
            var propName = propertyNames[index]
            console.log( "At index",index, "the value of character." + propName, "is:", character[propName] )
          }
        </script>
        <p>The last loop demonstrates how to combine Object.keys() and the array-like notation for objects. That is going to be useful for creating the template engine!</p>

        <p>Create a new function, that takes two arguments:</p>

        <p>The function has a loop (which one?) that calls the render function for each object in the array, with the template.</p>
        <p>All HTML strings returned by the calls to the render function are concatenated in one large HTML string. The large HTML string will be the return value after loop has visited all objects in the array.</p>
        <p>Write your function in such a way that it can work with any template, any kind of data oject, and arrays of any length. And test it with the playlist and the songTemplate.</p>

        <h2>Using loops in arduino</h2>
        <p>In arduino loops can be used for reasons similar to those in javascript, but there are some differences. In this theory block, we’ll quickly discuss looping though arrays and a different kind op loop in arduino.</p>
        <h4>Arrays in arduino</h4>
        <p>We have seen that for-loops are the best way to loop through arrays. This is also true in arduino, but because arrays in arduino do not have a <code>.length</code> property like in javascript, you'll just have to use the length of the array as a number. Luckily, you already needed this number when declaring the array. In the code below, note the <code>4</code> in the array declaration as well as the <code>4</code> in the for-loop condition.</p>
        
        <script type="text/plain" class="language-arduino">
#include "breadboard.h"
int ledPins[4] = {LED_RED, LED_YELLOW, LED_BLUE, LED_GREEN};

void setup(){
initializeBreadboard();
  for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++){
    digitalWrite(ledPins[i], HIGH);
    delay(100);
    digitalWrite(ledPins[i], LOW);  
    delay(100);
  }
}

void loop(){
  
}
        </script>
      <h4>Custom loops in arduino</h4>
      <p>Loops in arduino can also be used to change the mode of your program. An example of a mode change is when you have an alarm clock and you want to change the alarm time. You have to press a button to enter the "change alarm mode", and from that moment on, all buttons get different functions which enable you to change the alarm time. Once you are done, usually after a certain button is pressed or after some time has lapsed, the normal mode is resumed. </p>
      <p>A version of such a program is shown below. In it, the loop is constantly listening for button presses. If one happens, the program enters the corresponding mode. If BUTTON2 is pressed while in such a mode, something happens, depending on the mode. If BUTTON1 is pressed, the program returns to the loop because the while condition becomes false.</p>
      <script type="text/plain" class="language-arduino">
#include "s4d_breadboard.h"

void setup(){
  initializeBreadboard();
}

void loop(){
  OLED.print( "Normal mode" ) ;
  if (digitalRead(BUTTON1) == HIGH) {
    delay(200); // delay is to give user the chance to release the button
    blinkMode();
  }

  if(digitalRead(BUTTON2) == HIGH){
    delay(200); // delay is to give user the chance to release the button
    beepMode();
  }
}

void beepMode(){
  OLED.print( "beepMode" )  ;
  while (digitalRead(BUTTON1) == LOW ) {
    beep();
  }
  delay(200); // delay is to give user the chance to release the button
}

void blinkMode(){
  OLED.print( "blinkMode" )  ;
  while (digitalRead(BUTTON1) == LOW) {
    flashRedLED();
  }
  delay(200); // delay is to give user the chance to release the button
}

void flashRedLED() {
  digitalWrite(LED_RED, HIGH);
  delay(40);
  digitalWrite(LED_RED, LOW);
  delay(20);
}

void beep() {
  tone(BUZZER, 1500 );
  delay(40);
  noTone(BUZZER);
  delay(20);
}

  </script>
  <h4>Empty loops in arduino</h4>
  <p>Another thing that sometimes happens in arduino program is using while-loops with no code inside, that repeat "nothing" forever until the condition becomes true. These loops can come in very handy if you want nothing to happen until a button is pressed, or a sensor reading exceeds a certain value. The excersise below is about those loops. </p>

        <h3>13.9: Waiting game </h3>
        <p>In this assignment, you'll create a function that pauses the program until a button is pressed.</p>
        <script type="text/plain" class="language-arduino">
#include "s4d_breadboard.h"

void setup(){

        <p>The given code should (when complete) wait for a user to press a button until executing the beep command.</p>
<p>Modify the condition of the while loop in such a way that the <code>waitForButtonPress()</code> function pauses the loop.</p>
<hint steps=1>
  <p>Only modify the condition of the while-loop, the code inside of it can remain empty. We don't want anything to happen while we are waiting for the button to be pressed!</p>

        <h3>13.10: Custom Delay </h3>
        <p>In this assignment, you'll build your own delay function which can listen to user interaction while waiting.</p>

        <p>Make a program that has the following features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>5 seconds after a button is pressed, the RED LED turns on.</li>
          <li>If a user presses a button before the 5 seconds have passed, a tone should play, notifying the user he/she is too early.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using the <code>delay(5000)</code> function will not work in this instance as the whole program freezes while the delay is being executed. Build your own custom delay function called <code>waitMode(5000);</code>using the <code>millis()</code> function and a while loop. Note that you don't have to leave the while loop empty. I want to be able to call my function like this <code>waitMode(5000);</code> </p>
        <hint steps=1>
  <ul>
    <li>Does the function called with the <code>waitMode(5000)</code> command have a parameter? </li>
    <li>Does the function called with the <code>waitMode(5000)</code> command have a return value? </li>
    <li>What is condition of the while-loop inside the <code>waitMode</code> function? </li>
    <li>What code should be executed inside of the while-loop? </li>
</ul>

        <p>The given code should beep after 15 seconds have passed. There is no option to change the time yet.</p>
        <p>When BUTTON2 is clicked, the program should enter "change time mode". Make a function with a while-loop that represents this mode.</p>
        <p>While in "change time mode", the display should show the position of the potmeter * 100. If the button is pressed, use this number to update the beepTime variable. Make sure the timer is turned on.</p>
