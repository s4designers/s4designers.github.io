  <h1>Chapter 5: russian dolls for data: variables <i>inside</i> variables</h1>
   <p>This chapter introduces two topics: Arrays and Objects.</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Arrays are used for lists of information.</li>
     <li>Objects are used to group information belongs together.</li>

      <h3 class="assignment questions">5.5 arrays in objects</h3>
      
      <p>
        A variable can contain an array as its value. A property of an object can also contain an array as its value. Suppose the four spells are the spells Luna knows. Add an array of spells to the "spells" property of luna. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>If you are succesfull, the following code would work to access the first spell: console.log(wizard.spells[0]), where wizard is the name of the variable containing the object.</i>

      <p>
        A variable can contain an object as its value. An array can also contain multiple objects as its items. Make a "wizards" array containing not only Luna (and all her properties), but also another wizard (and all of his/her properties). 
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>If you are succesfull, the following code would work to access the second wizards name: console.log(wizards[1].name).</i>
